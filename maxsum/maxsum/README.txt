This is a simple utility to calculate the max continuous subsum of an 2two-dimension array. 

This project is a win32 console project. You need to use the command "maxsum.exe sourcefile" to run the program properly. Meanwhile the program accept a group of option [/v][/h][/a].
With /v on program will think the array rotative vertically. With /h on program will think the array rotativ horizontally. With /a on the porgram will output a maxsum of unicom block not a rectangle of block.

File example.txt contains several simpleexapmles. File data1.txt is ordinary large test data. It contain a 500*500 array, and each element is restrict to be between -32768 and 32767. It is used to test the performence of the program.
